Project Description Outline:

The goal of our project is to develop a model that forecasts future consumer online purchases based on online shopping data. We will investigate various key factors that influence purchasing decisions, including the relationships between payment methods, the impact of discounts on sales, and purchase trends across different countries overtime. Additionally, we will explore other relevant patterns within the data to uncover valuable insights that can help businesses optimize their sales strategies and anticipate customer behavior.



Questions To Answer With The Data:




Dataset To Be Used:

* Online Sales Dataset - Online Shopping Patterns and Retail Performance Dataset
    * Number of Records: 49,782
    * Dates: 1/1/2020 - 9/5/2025
    * Columns: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country, Discount, PaymentMethod, ShippingCost, Category, SalesChannel, ReturnStatus, ShipmentProvider, WarehouseLocation, OrderPriority



Tasks:
* Clean the data
* Normalize and standardize the data for the ML model
* Create initial visualizations
* Write Python script that initializes and trains an ML model using Scikit-learn (or another ML library), splits the data into training and testing sets, and evaluates the modelâ€™s predictive power (aim for at least 75% accuracy or 0.80 R-squared)
* Create ML model visualizations
